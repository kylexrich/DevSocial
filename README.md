# DevSocial
This is a social media app tailored towards developers. Users can do things such as create and edit their profile, make posts, comment, and like.

## Motivation
I used this project as a stepping stone to develop the skills necessary to build another project I have always been interested in creating -- a social media productivity app where you can compete with your friends to see who is most productive. This project was perfect, as it taught me many of the things I need to know to accomplish what I have in mind for future projects. Determined to learn the MERN stack and workflow, I followed tutorials created by Brad Traversy to help me build this.
